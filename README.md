# Chatbot Application

A simple, interactive chatbot built with React. This chatbot responds to user messages, detects sentiment, and replies accordingly. It uses emojis for sentiment feedback and allows users to clear the conversation.

## Features

- **Sentiment Detection**: Detects whether the user's message is positive, negative, or angry and responds accordingly.
- **Dynamic Bot Responses**: Responds to common phrases like greetings, farewells, and thank-yous.
- **Emoji Feedback**: The bot displays emojis based on the sentiment of the user's message (happy, sad, angry).
- **LocalStorage**: Stores conversation history in the browser's local storage so the chat persists across page reloads.
- **Clear Chat**: Option to clear the entire chat history with a single click.
